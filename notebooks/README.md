## FHIR-MolDef-python Educational Notebook Series

This collection of Jupyter notebooks provides a hands-on introduction to using the FHIR-MolDef-Python codebase. The notebooks demonstrate how to work with the HL7 FHIR MolecularDefinition Resource, MolecularDefinition Profiles, and the bidirectional translation between GA4GH VRS (version 1.3) and HL7 FHIR MolecularDefinition. For instructions on running these notebooks in Codespaces, please refer to the main project [README](../README.md), which includes step-by-step setup guidance.


## Notebooks

* [MolecularDefinitoin](molecular_definition_demo.ipynb): Demonstrates the Python implementation of the HL7 FHIR MolecularDefinition Resource, providing a structured, step-by-step approach to constructing a MolecularDefinition resource.
* [AlleleProfile](allele_profile_demo.ipynb): Showcases the Python implementation of the HL7 FHIR AlleleProfile, guiding users through the process of constructing an AlleleProfile resource.
* [SequenceProfile](sequence_profile_demo.ipynb): Explores the Python implementation of the HL7 FHIR SequenceProfile, outlining a step-by-step approach to building a SequenceProfile resource.
* [VRS to FHIR translation](vrs_translation_to_allele_profile_demo.ipynb): Demonstrates how to translate GA4GH VRS (version 1.3) representations into HL7 FHIR AlleleProfile.
* [FHIR to VRS translation](allele_profile_to_vrs_translation_demo.ipynb): Demonstrates how to translate HL7 FHIR AlleleProfile into GA4GH VRS (version 1.3) representations.
